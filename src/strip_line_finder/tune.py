"""Automatic choice of the detection settings from one image.

There is no reference answer to compare with, so the tuner looks for settings
that give a *stable* answer: it sweeps the detection threshold and looks for
plateaus, ranges of thresholds over which the number of accepted lines does not
change. A wide plateau means the lines stand clearly apart from the noise, and
the middle of it is a safe threshold.

For each background-filter size (half, normal and double the default):
  1. the line signal is computed once;
  2. about 80 thresholds, evenly spaced on a log scale from the noise floor to
     the strongest peak, are tried and the accepted lines counted;
  3. runs of equal count (>= 2 lines, at least ``min_ratio`` wide) are plateaus.
     A plateau must keep at least ``keep`` (default half) of the lines found at
     the noise floor; otherwise "only the few strongest lines" would always win,
     because strong lines stay put over a very wide threshold range.
The widest plateau is the first choice. A plateau that runs into the lower end
of the sweep counts half, because its true width is unknown (the count may
still be growing towards the noise floor). The base settings are always among
the candidates, and the alternatives follow by how little they change the line
count, so answering "n" in the folder analysis gives small steps first. Each plateau becomes a ``DetectionConfig``:

  rel        = threshold / strong-response level of this image (so it scales
               with brightness)
  bg_window  = the filter size of the plateau
  min_dist   = at most half the smallest gap between accepted lines
  x_tol      = from the measured tilt of the lines (never below the default)

The threshold never goes below ``k * sigma`` (noise floor, ``k`` from the base
config), so the sweep cannot end up counting noise as lines. The other fields (n_blocks, k, min_fraction, band_rel, smooth, half_width) are
copied from the base config. ``min_fraction`` is not tuned: a line is accepted
at the base value by construction, so the weakest accepted line can never
justify a different one.
