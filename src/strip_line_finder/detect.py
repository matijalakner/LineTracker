"""Vertical line detection (column method).

1. The image is cut into ``n_blocks`` horizontal bands. Each band is reduced
   to one colour profile along x by taking the median over its rows (robust
   against dust and local defects).
2. Per colour channel a moving-median background (``bg_window`` px) is
   subtracted at 1-px resolution; the largest deviation over R, G and B is the
   line strength of that column. Colour steps between wide stripes stay in the
   background, only narrow features remain.
3. After a light smoothing, the band-averaged signal is searched for local
   maxima above ``max(k * sigma, rel * strong-response level)`` that are at
   least ``min_dist`` px apart (the strongest wins).
4. A candidate is accepted only if it is also visible (at least
   ``band_rel * threshold``, within ``x_tol`` px) in ``min_fraction`` of the
   bands. This removes specks and defects such as a bubble that covers only
   part of the image height, while faint lines in compressed video survive.

Size-dependent parameters (``bg_window``, ``min_dist``, ``x_tol``) default to
``None`` and are scaled from the image width (tuned on a 6000 px wide frame).
